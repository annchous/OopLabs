## Backup App
### Laboratory work â„–4

### [Solution](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/tree/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp)

### [Tests](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/tree/lab4/OopLabs/BackupAppTest)

### [Code description](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/Tasks/Lab4BackupApp.md#code-description)

### Usage example

#### Create new backup

```
-n -s file1_fullpath file2_fullpath -df datafile_name -c 3
-n -c common_folder file1_fullpath file2_fullpath -df datafile -h -m -c 5 -d 05.11.2020
```

#### Create restore point

```
-r datafile -f
-r datafile -i
```

#### Add/Delete file from backup

```
-a/-d datafile fileToDeletePath
```

### Condition

As part of the laboratory work, it is meant the development of a system that controls the process of creating backups. To simplify the lab, you do not need to physically back up the specified files. It will be enough to create a record that the backup was made.

```
FileRestoreCopyInfo CreateRestore (string filePath)
{
var fileInfo = new FileInfo (filePath);
    var fileRestoreCopyInfo = new FileRestoreCopyInfo (filePath, fileInfo.Size, DateTime.Now);
//File.Copy(filePath, _pathWhereWeNeedToStoreOurBackup); <- This part we can skip
return fileRestoreCopyInfo;
}
```

Backup information is presented as a set of parameters: Id, CreationTime, BackupSize and a list of restore points.

### Creation and storage algorithms

To create a backup, the following objects are specified: a list of files. It should be possible to subsequently edit this list - add and remove objects from the list of objects that will be processed in the algorithm.

The system must support several algorithms for creating restore points for backup, as well as the ability to increase their number. The result of the algorithm is the creation of a new restore point for the specified backup. A recovery point stores information about itself about what objects were backed up in it. The algorithm should be able to indicate whether it is required to create a full-fledged point or only a delta from the last time (i.e. an increment).

It is required to implement at least two storage algorithms:

1. Algorithm of separate storage - files are copied to a special folder and stored there separately.
2. Shared storage algorithm - all objects specified in the backup are added to one archive.

### Point cleaning algorithms

In addition to creation, you need to control the number of stored recovery points. To prevent the accumulation of a large number of old and irrelevant points, it is necessary to implement mechanisms for their cleaning - they must control so that the chain of recovery points does not go beyond the acceptable limit. Within the laboratory, the following types of limits are implied:

1. By quantity - limits the length of the chain of recovery points (we store the last N points)
2. By date - limits how old points will be stored (we store all points that were made no later than the specified date)
3. By size - limits the total size of the backup (we store all the latest backups, the total size of which does not exceed the limit)
4. Hybrid - the ability to combine limits. The user can specify how to combine:
    - you need to delete a point if it went beyond at least one set limit
    - you need to delete the point if it went beyond all the established limits

    For example, the user selects a hybrid of "by quantity" and "by date" algorithms. If according to one of the algorithms it is necessary to leave 3 points, and according to the other - 5, then the number of points is selected in accordance with the parameter specified when creating the "hybrid" (use the maximum or minimum value of the selected points).

The algorithm must take into account that the incremental points should not be left without the point from which the delta is taken. If it was necessary to leave more points than planned, the result of the algorithm should return a corresponding warning.


### Code description

### [Abstractions](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/tree/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Abstractions)

#### [Algorithm.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Abstractions/Algorithm.cs)

An abstract class with a common implementation of cleanup recovery points for all algorithms:
```
public void Clean(ref Backup backup, StorageType storageType)
```
The method of deleting unnecessary points depends on the storage method: in common type the folder of the restore point itself with a backup of all files is deleted, and in separate type of storage the folders with the restore point for each backup are deleted one by one.

#### [IApp.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Abstractions/IApp.cs) and [ICleanable.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Abstractions/ICleanable.cs)

Interfaces implemented in the console interaction class and in the algorithm.

#### [RestorePoint.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Abstractions/RestorePoint.cs)

The base abstract class for the **restore point** entity.

### [Implementations](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/tree/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations)

#### [AlgorithmSystem](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/tree/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/AlgorithmSystem)

#### [Cleaner.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/AlgorithmSystem/Cleaner.cs)

Contains a method that starts the cleanup algorithm for the backup:
```
public void Clean()
```
Implements ```ICleanable``` interface.

**Implementations of four algorithms:**
* [CountAlgorithm.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/AlgorithmSystem/CountAlgorithm.cs)
* [DateAlgorithm.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/AlgorithmSystem/DateAlgorithm.cs)

#### [Backup.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/BackupSystem/Backup.cs)

Represents the entity of the backup. 
In this case, the backup for each tracked file is different, therefore this class stores a list of restore points for one specific file.

```
public Guid Id { get; } // backup id
public string FilePath { get; } // path to backuping file
public string BackupFolderPath { get; } // path to backup folder
public List<RestorePoint> RestorePoints { get; } // restore points list
public int RestorePointsCount { get; set; } // counter for correct naming of files with restore points
```

#### [BackupManager.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/BackupSystem/BackupManager.cs)

Represents an entity that stores all backups (an object of the ```Backup``` class for each file) and information about the storage type and the cleaning algorithm.

#### [RestorePointSystem](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/tree/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/RestorePointSystem)

Contains implementations of two types of restore points:
* [FullRestorePoint.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/RestorePointSystem/FullRestorePoint.cs)
* [IncrementalRestorePoint.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/RestorePointSystem/IncrementalRestorePoint.cs)

Static class for parsing command line arguments.

#### [ConsoleBackupApp.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Core/Implementations/ConsoleSystem/ConsoleBackupApp.cs)

Launched in ```Main```. Implements ```BackupManager``` entity creation and serializes / deserializes information into a date file.

#### [Exceptions](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/tree/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Exceptions)

Custom exceptions.

#### [Program.cs](https://github.com/annchous/OopLabs/blob/lab4/OopLabs/BackupApp/Program.cs)

Contains the ```Main``` method.
